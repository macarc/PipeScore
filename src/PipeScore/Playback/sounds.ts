 *
 * The solution is to split up a tied note into its constituent notes,
 * then set .durationIncludingTies on the first note (so that the first
 * note plays for the full length, but the .play() function returns after
 * its normal length), and then emit SoundedSilence objects for each
 * next tied note. Then the cursor is updated, synchronisation can still
 * happen, and the note sounds continuous.
